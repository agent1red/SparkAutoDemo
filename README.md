# SparkAuto App Demo

This small Car Service App demonstrates my knowledge of the following technologies:

- Basic C# ASP.NET Core 3.1 using Razor Pages.  
- Integration of the Entity Framework through a code first approach.  
- Basic Security, Authentication and Authorization.  
- ASP Tag Helpers, HTML, Bootstrap CSS.  
- Data Seeding.  
- Azure basic deployment to the cloud.

Create an account and log in to explore the app. (Disregard logging in with Facebook or Google).   
The admin adds cars and services for the customer via admin control. The customer can only view their  
car services and information.
